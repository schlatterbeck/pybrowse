PyBrowse: Send text or html to browser

This is a small framework to send text (e.g. from an email) to a browser
with markup of URLs found in the text. Alternatively we can also
directly send html (from html attachments etc.) to the browser.

This is modeled after the "webbrowse" program written in perl.
